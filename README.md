# ToDo

Plans for the mod
- [ ] tag-comments for a tile instead of handwriting comments, starts by '#' and list recents for current task
- [ ] ability to resume last activity
- [ ] merge adjacent records for selected timerangeÂ if tag-comment is empty (for at least one) or identical
- [ ] day planning: plan tasks and expected runtime, incorrect order of execution is still a good thing, reminders on sacrificing other activities for a day when overdue
- [ ] connect with my internal project for data analysis
- [ ] communication with gearOS

To be a good contributor, not a leech, there will be streams that will propose fixes and functionalities to the upstream
